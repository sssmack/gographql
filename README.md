# gographql

package gographql translates Go struct types to Graphql types.

Why gographql?

gographql allows the declaration of the graphql schema to be declared by the Go structures as the structures are declared in the code.  gographql uses Go reflection and so the schema is created at run-time.


## Install

```shell
go get github.com/sssmack/gographql
```

**Note:** gographql uses [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) to manage dependencies.
